 * \brief Prescription for molecular simulation.
 *
 * In the first implementation, this is a POD struct to allow removal of direct
 * references to TPR and CPT files from Mdrunner. The interface for SimulationInput
 * should be considered to be *completely unspecified* until resolution of
 * https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues/3374
 *
 * Clients should use the utility functions defined in simulationinpututility.h
 *
 * Design note: It is probably sufficient for future versions to compose SimulationInput
 * through a Builder rather than to subclass an Interface or base class. Outside of this
 * translation unit, we should avoid coupling to the class definition until/unless we
 * develop a much better understanding of simulation input portability.

 *
 * Acquire global simulation data structures from the SimulationInput handle.
 * Note that global data is returned in the calling thread. In parallel
 * computing contexts, the client is responsible for calling only where needed.
 *
 * Example:
 *    if (SIMMAIN(cr))
 *    {
 *        // Only the main rank has the global state
 *        globalState = globalSimulationState(simulationInput);
 *

 *        applyGlobalInputRecord(simulationInput, inputrec);
 *        applyGlobalTopology(simulationInput, &mtop);
 *     }
 *
 * \todo Factor the logic for global/local and main-rank-checks.
 * The SimulationInput utilities should behave properly for the various distributed data scenarios.
 * Consider supplying data directly to the consumers rather than exposing the
 * implementation details of the legacy aggregate types.
